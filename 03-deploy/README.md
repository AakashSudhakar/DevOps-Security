# Class 3: Deploy the Demo app

A good way to study a subject is to look at functioning systems. 
The domain of cyber security is large and complex. We will 
focus on a small scale project that has some of the features 
that are found in larger sites. 

## Activities

- Presentations
  - Students present articles from class 1
- Installing the demo app.
  - Deploy the app to heroku
  - Overview of the App
    - Built with Express
    - sqlite database 
    - Users Login




## Activities

  - Deploy on Heroku or other similar services (WeDeploy, Zeit, etc)
    - Deploy an app (I do, we do) - App is ready
    - What webpacks you need to deploy that app + DB
    - Configure that app with addons needs + webpacks
  - Pair and discuss how secure is an app or site deployed to Heroku (optional, at the end of lab)

## Challenge
  
  - Add more functionality to site or app, more interaction with user (inputs, state, buttons, etc)
