# SQL injection 











## Activities
  - Groups present the top 10 attacks of 2017
    - Each group presents for 5 mins with Q & A after

  - Quick chat about cloud
  - Pair and share about AWS services (EC2, S3, lamba, Elastic Beenstalk, Database storage)
    (each group study one of them for 15 min and present)
  - I do, we do: Deploy static html page or document to AWS S3 (ftp, web, ssh)
    - Make this document public available
    - Delete this document afterwards (so you don't get billed)

## Objectives
  - Analyze current attacks from 2017

  - Explain cloud services
  - Deploy code and assets
  - Apply permissions on internet resources

## Challenge
  - Deploy to AWS EC2 or other similar service
    (follow EC2 docs or search for a EC2 deploy tutorial)

## Resources
  - [EC2 deploy docs](https://aws.amazon.com/documentation/ec2/)




## Notes

- https://www.hacksplaining.com/lessons


- We might shorten this lesson to just data security.
  - What data does the internet have
  - why you need to secure the data you store
  - Best practices. Might be good to talk about best practices for storing data.
