# Class 5: Explore vulnerabilities

## Activities
  - What is the most common explored vulnerability? Bad passwords!
  - Pair and share: Discuss common passwords
  - In groups: Run a brute force script to see how long it takes to get to guess a string
    (e.g.: how long does a it take to guess password `password` or `asdf123` or a stronger password like `B120cd$!`)
    - Use a website/service that creates strong passwords

## Objectives
  - Find and explore vulnerabilities
  - Grasp how websites and apps can be vulnerable and attacked if you have weak passwords
  - Think of ways and techniques to prevent basic attacks such as password guessing

## Challenge
  - Come up with a description that teaches people how to create a strong password following todays guidelines

Maybe we could use this as an assignment or exercise:

This lesson could be expanded into two or three sessions.

Lesson idea: Password Meter. Build an app that measures password strength.
