# Class 5: Explore vulnerabilities

This week is hack week. Your goal is to play the role of hacker. 
You are going to hack other classmates sites. 

## What to exploit? 

Exploit the XSS vulnerabilities do you best 

## Challenges

Your first job is to add an AJAX call that adds a Clap count to 
posts. Each post should track the number of times it can be 
clapped. This can be a simple implementation. We are putting 
it in just to break it! The method should be implemented via 
AJAX in clientside JavaScript. 

Your second job is to hack your classmates sites. Look at the 
list of sites and try out the exploits on each. 

## Stretch Challenges

Make your Exploits creative. Don't just break things.
